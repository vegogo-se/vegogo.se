Upside a narrow street between crowdy Götgatsbacken and beautiful Mosebacke this small hipster bar offers two great things: craft beer and pizza (the menus changes very seasonally).

A tasty vegan pizza is always on the handwritten menu on the wall. 130 SEK and has always been worth waiting for. We also make a cheer for the arty interior - everything from the lightning and the porcelain plates to the smiling pizza oven.
